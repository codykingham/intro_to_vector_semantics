        /shall be saved; but he that   believeth not shall be damned./
      lifted up: 3:15 That whosoever   believeth in him  should not/    /be
      /begotten Son,  that whosoever   believeth in him should not perish/
    /might be saved.    3:18 He that   believeth on him is not condemned:/
       is not condemned: but he that   believeth  not is condemned/    /him
     into his  hand.    3:36 He that   believeth on the Son hath/   /things
      /everlasting life: and he that   believeth not the Son shall not/

     shall never hunger; and he that   believeth on me shall never/     /me
       one which  seeth the Son, and   believeth on him, may have/   /every

     /me, and drink.    7:38 He that   believeth on me, as the scripture/
           /, and the life: he  that   believeth in me, though he were/

     /said, He that believeth on me,   believeth not on  me, but on him/
     /into the world, that whosoever   believeth on me  should not abide/
    /verily, I say unto you, He that   believeth on me, the  works that I/
        /through his name  whosoever   believeth in him shall receive/
        /salvation to every one that   believeth; to the Jew first,  and/
    /and the justifier of  him which   believeth in Jesus.    3:27 Where/

      /any brother hath a wife  that   believeth not, and she be pleased/
         /which hath an husband that   believeth not, and if he  be/
        /; 13:7  Beareth all things,   believeth all things, hopeth all/

   of/       /the world, but he that   believeth that  Jesus is the Son
        /of his Son.    5:10 He that   believeth on the Son of God hath/
       /witness in himself:  he that   believeth not God hath made him a/
        /made him a liar; because he   believeth  not the record that God/
